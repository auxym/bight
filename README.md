# Bight

> Bight (noun): A U-shaped part in the middle of a length of rope.

So, the opposite of an *end*, in a way.

Bight is a Nim library to handle byte ordering, an alternative to [std/endians](https://nim-lang.org/docs/endians.html) and [stew/endians2](https://github.com/status-im/nim-stew/blob/master/stew/endians2.nim), based on the C implementation proposed in [justine.lol/endian.html](https://justine.lol/endian.html).

Simple read/write API with both value and pointer overloads. No swapping, just say which order and size you want.
